My own notes about Investment banking course taught by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on Coursera 

## Module 1

### Introduction to Financial Spreads

* Fundamental concept in valuation is ***comparability***: Between periods/points of time; Across companies.

#### How do we enable comparability analysis?

* Create a ***financial spread***;
* Assemble financial data in a ***consistent format***;

#### Spread must be in a Standardised Format

* General company information
* Market data
* Balance sheet data
* Income statement (reported/adjusted)
* Fully diluted shares
* Trading multiples/growth rates

#### Getting Financial Data

* SEC Filings - Historical financial data (public)
* Audited Financials - Historical financial data (public and private)
* Proxy statements - Share data (public)
* Bloomberg, Capital IQ, Yahoo finance - Market data

### Multiples

#### Valuation Multiples

* Multiples may be based on past performance or future expectations
* LTM = ***Latest twelve months*** = past performance;
* NFY = ***Next fiscal year*** = future expectations for the next year-end;
* NFY + 1 = One year after the next fiscal year end;

#### Enterprise vs. Equity Value

* Equity Value (Market Capitalisation) + Total Debt Securities + Preferred Stock + Noncontrolling Interest - Cash and Cash Equivalents = Enterprise Value (EV)
* Total debt securities ***minus*** cash and cash equivalents = ***net debt***.

#### Equity Value & Equity Value Multiples

* Equity Value = Market Capitalisation = Stock Price * Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding

***Common Equity Value Multiples***:

* Equity Value/Net Income - Price/Earnings
* Equity Value/Book Equity Value - Price/Book

#### Enterprise Value (EV) Multiples

Derived by dividing enterprise value by specific metric:
* EV/Revenue
* EV/EBIT
* EV/EBITDA

A company with good ***prospects*** for profitability and growth should ***trade at a higher multiple*** than its peers.
