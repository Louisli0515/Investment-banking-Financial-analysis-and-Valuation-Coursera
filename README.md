My own notes about Investment banking course taught by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on Coursera 

## Module 1

### Introduction to Financial Spreads

* Fundamental concept in valuation is ***comparability***: Between periods/points of time; Across companies.

#### How do we enable comparability analysis?

* Create a ***financial spread***;
* Assemble financial data in a ***consistent format***;

#### Spread must be in a Standardised Format

* General company information
* Market data
* Balance sheet data
* Income statement (reported/adjusted)
* Fully diluted shares
* Trading multiples/growth rates

#### Getting Financial Data

* SEC Filings - Historical financial data (public)
* Audited Financials - Historical financial data (public and private)
* Proxy statements - Share data (public)
* Bloomberg, Capital IQ, Yahoo finance - Market data

### Multiples

#### Valuation Multiples

* Multiples may be based on past performance or future expectations
* LTM = ***Latest twelve months*** = past performance;
* NFY = ***Next fiscal year*** = future expectations for the next year-end;
* NFY + 1 = One year after the next fiscal year end;

#### Enterprise vs. Equity Value

* Equity Value (Market Capitalisation) + Total Debt Securities + Preferred Stock + Noncontrolling Interest - Cash and Cash Equivalents = Enterprise Value (EV)
* Total debt securities ***minus*** cash and cash equivalents = ***net debt***.

#### Equity Value & Equity Value Multiples

* Equity Value = Market Capitalisation = Stock Price * Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding

***Common Equity Value Multiples***:

* Equity Value/Net Income - Price/Earnings
* Equity Value/Book Equity Value - Price/Book

#### Enterprise Value (EV) Multiples

Derived by dividing enterprise value by specific metric:
* EV/Revenue
* EV/EBIT
* EV/EBITDA

A company with good ***prospects*** for profitability and growth should ***trade at a higher multiple*** than its peers.

### Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding

#### Basic vs. Fully Diluted Shars - When to Use?

* ***Always*** use fully diluted shares;
* Dilution is built into a company's stock price: The market accounts for the impact of dilutie securities;

#### What are dilutive securities?

Financial instruments that if exercised would reduce, or "dilute" basic EPS (earnings pershare). Most common:

* Stock options
* Warrants
* Restricted stock units (RSUs)
* Convertible preferred stocks
* Convertible bonds

#### Stock Options / Warrants

***Treasury stock method*** used to determine dilutive impact

* Assume that all "in the money" options and warrants exericsed.
* Exercised shares are added to basic shares.
* Money received from exercise are used to repurchase shares.
* Repurchased shares become treasury stock and reduce basic shares.
* Net of shares exericsed, and shares repurchased is dilutive impact.

#### What is "in the money"

* Grant price = price of stock at ***date of grant***
* Current price = price of stock today
* "In the money" = Current > Grant
* "Out of the money" = Current < Grant

#### Restricted Stock Units

* Treated as stock options with a ***grant price of zero***
* Total amount of RSUs treated as dilutive securities.

#### Convertible Securities (Preferred Stock and Debt)

* Look at conversion price/ conversion ratios to determine number of shares.

#### Recap - Fully Diluted Shares

* Fully diluted shares outstanding = Basic shares outstanding Options/ Warrants - net addition(TSM) + RSUs (all) + Convertible securities(outstanding * conversion rate)

### Financial Adjustments

#### Review of the Spread Template

* The Income Statement and the Cash Flow Data show up in the "Reported Financial Data" section of the spread template.
* Records three years of historical data and the latest twelve months.
* ***DO NOT*** modify the form of the template; conform the company's presentation to fit the template line items.

#### Stub periods

* Shows year-to-date (YTD) financial data
* Use to derive latest-twelve-month (LTM) financial data
* LTM = Current stub + Prior year - Prior stub

#### Calendarisation

* Not every company has the same year-end date
* Most are 12/31; but many are not.
* Important to ***convert*** all companies being analysed to same year-end

#### Financial adjustments

* Many historical financial statements are not "clean": - One-time charges; Extradordinary items.
* Other times the financial presentation is not "comparable" between companies.
* Reminder: Comparability/standardisation of data is key.

#### Financial adjustment examples

* Severance expense: not expected to happen every period.
* Gain on sale of a building: Don't do it often; unrelated to operations.

#### How to Locate Adjustments

* Look on the face of the Income Statement
* Do a search for Key Words in 10-K and 10-Q

## Module 2

### Introduction to Valuation Analysis

#### Valuation Observations

Valuation is both an art and a science

* The art is picking the best comparables and normalising financial statements which requires judgement.
* The science is that the models and valuation techniques used all follow the same established corporate finance frame works.

Valuation analysis has many applications

* M&A
* Public offerings
* Restructurings
* Investment decisions

#### Public Companies - Stock Price

For companies listed on stock exchange

* Share Price
* Public Research

Stock price - moment in time

* True value does not fluctuate each day
* Perform analytics to assess valuation ranges
