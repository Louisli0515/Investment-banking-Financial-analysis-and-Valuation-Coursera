My own notes about Investment banking course taught by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on Coursera 

## Module 1

### Introduction to Financial Spreads

* Fundamental concept in valuation is ***comparability***: Between periods/points of time; Across companies.

#### How do we enable comparability analysis?

* Create a ***financial spread***;
* Assemble financial data in a ***consistent format***;

#### Spread must be in a Standardised Format

* General company information
* Market data
* Balance sheet data
* Income statement (reported/adjusted)
* Fully diluted shares
* Trading multiples/growth rates

#### Getting Financial Data

* SEC Filings - Historical financial data (public)
* Audited Financials - Historical financial data (public and private)
* Proxy statements - Share data (public)
* Bloomberg, Capital IQ, Yahoo finance - Market data

### Multiples

#### Valuation Multiples

* Multiples may be based on past performance or future expectations
* LTM = ***Latest twelve months*** = past performance;
* NFY = ***Next fiscal year*** = future expectations for the next year-end;
* NFY + 1 = One year after the next fiscal year end;

#### Enterprise vs. Equity Value

* Equity Value (Market Capitalisation) + Total Debt Securities + Preferred Stock + Noncontrolling Interest - Cash and Cash Equivalents = Enterprise Value (EV)
* Total debt securities ***minus*** cash and cash equivalents = ***net debt***.

#### Equity Value & Equity Value Multiples

* Equity Value = Market Capitalisation = Stock Price * Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding

***Common Equity Value Multiples***:

* Equity Value/Net Income - Price/Earnings
* Equity Value/Book Equity Value - Price/Book

#### Enterprise Value (EV) Multiples

Derived by dividing enterprise value by specific metric:
* EV/Revenue
* EV/EBIT
* EV/EBITDA

A company with good ***prospects*** for profitability and growth should ***trade at a higher multiple*** than its peers.

### Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding

#### Basic vs. Fully Diluted Shars - When to Use?

* ***Always*** use fully diluted shares;
* Dilution is built into a company's stock price: The market accounts for the impact of dilutie securities;

#### What are dilutive securities?

Financial instruments that if exercised would reduce, or "dilute" basic EPS (earnings pershare). Most common:

* Stock options
* Warrants
* Restricted stock units (RSUs)
* Convertible preferred stocks
* Convertible bonds

#### Stock Options / Warrants

***Treasury stock method*** used to determine dilutive impact

* Assume that all "in the money" options and warrants exericsed.
* Exercised shares are added to basic shares.
* Money received from exercise are used to repurchase shares.
* Repurchased shares become treasury stock and reduce basic shares.
* Net of shares exericsed, and shares repurchased is dilutive impact.

#### What is "in the money"

* Grant price = price of stock at ***date of grant***
* Current price = price of stock today
* "In the money" = Current > Grant
* "Out of the money" = Current < Grant

#### Restricted Stock Units

* Treated as stock options with a ***grant price of zero***
* Total amount of RSUs treated as dilutive securities.

#### Convertible Securities (Preferred Stock and Debt)

* Look at conversion price/ conversion ratios to determine number of shares.

#### Recap - Fully Diluted Shares

* Fully diluted shares outstanding = Basic shares outstanding Options/ Warrants - net addition(TSM) + RSUs (all) + Convertible securities(outstanding * conversion rate)

### Financial Adjustments

#### Review of the Spread Template

* The Income Statement and the Cash Flow Data show up in the "Reported Financial Data" section of the spread template.
* Records three years of historical data and the latest twelve months.
* ***DO NOT*** modify the form of the template; conform the company's presentation to fit the template line items.

#### Stub periods

* Shows year-to-date (YTD) financial data
* Use to derive latest-twelve-month (LTM) financial data
* LTM = Current stub + Prior year - Prior stub

#### Calendarisation

* Not every company has the same year-end date
* Most are 12/31; but many are not.
* Important to ***convert*** all companies being analysed to same year-end

#### Financial adjustments

* Many historical financial statements are not "clean": - One-time charges; Extradordinary items.
* Other times the financial presentation is not "comparable" between companies.
* Reminder: Comparability/standardisation of data is key.

#### Financial adjustment examples

* Severance expense: not expected to happen every period.
* Gain on sale of a building: Don't do it often; unrelated to operations.

#### How to Locate Adjustments

* Look on the face of the Income Statement
* Do a search for Key Words in 10-K and 10-Q

## Module 2

### Introduction to Valuation Analysis

#### Valuation Observations

Valuation is both an art and a science

* The art is picking the best comparables and normalising financial statements which requires judgement.
* The science is that the models and valuation techniques used all follow the same established corporate finance frame works.

Valuation analysis has many applications

* M&A
* Public offerings
* Restructurings
* Investment decisions

#### Public Companies - Stock Price

For companies listed on stock exchange

* Share Price
* Public Research

Stock price - moment in time

* True value does not fluctuate each day
* Perform analytics to assess valuation ranges

#### Most Common Valuation Approaches

* Market-Based Valuation Multiples: Public Company Comparables Analysis "Public Comps" and Precedent Transactions Analysis "Transaction Comps"
* Future Cash-Flow Based: Discounted Cash-Flow Analysis "DCF" and Leveraged Buyout Analysis "LBO"
* ***Never rely on just one approach***.

#### Use of FDS and Normalised Earnings

* Stock Price * Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Market Value of Equity or "Market Capitalisation".
* Market Value of Equity + Total Debt Preferred Stock Non-Controlling Interest - Cash = Total Enterprise Value "TEV".
* Total Enterprise Value / Normalised Latest Twelve-Month EBITDA = Implied Valuation Multiple TEV/LTM EMBITDA.

#### Use the Implied Multiple to Calculate Valuation

* Implied Valuation Multiple TEV/LTM EBITDA * Adjusted LTM EBITDA of Business Being Valued = Implied Total Enterprise Value for Business Being Valued.

### Comparable Public Companies Analysis

Premise: Similar companies are hightly valuable reference points for valuation; share common:

* Operating and financial characteristics;
* Performance drivers;
* Business and environmental risks.

Considered a "current" valuation.

"Good", but not "perfect"

* Current market valuation levels may be historically high or low.
* No two companies are ***exactly the same***.

#### Five Steps to Perform Public Comparable Analysis

* Study the business you are valuing and select a list of comparable companies;
* Locate the necessary financial information;
* Review key statistics to select the right universe of companies to spread;
* Spread and benchmark the selected comparable companies;
* Calculate valuation statistics and apply them to the business you are valuing.

### Spreading Financial Information and Benchmarking

#### Financial Spreads Feed the Analysis

* Inputs: 10k Filings; 10q Filings; Stock Price; For Subject Company and Comparables
* To: Spread Template: Fully diluted share calculation; Make adjustments; LTM calculations
* Output: Benchmarking Output and Valuation Output

### Advantages and Disadvantages to Comparable Public Companies Analysis

#### Pros for Comparable Company Analysis

* ***Market Based*** - Information used to derive valuation for target is based on actual public market data, reflecting the market's growth and risks, as well as overall sentiment.
* ***Relativity*** - Easily measurable and comparable versus other companies.
* ***Quick and Convenient*** - Valuation can be determined on the basis of a few quick-to-calculate inputs.
* ***Current*** - Valuation is based on prevailing market data, which can be updated on a daily basis.

#### Cons for Comparable Company Analysis

* ***Market Based*** - Valuation that is completely market-based can be skewed during periods of irrationality in the market.
* ***Absence of relevant comparables*** - "Pure play" comparables may be difficult to identify or even nonexistent, especially if the target operates in a niche market.
* ***Potential disconnect from cash flow*** - Valuation based on prevailing market conditions or expectations may have significant disconnect from the valuation by a company's projected cash flow generation.
* ***Company-specific issues***: Valuation of the target is based on valuation of other companies, which may fail to capture target-specific strengths, weaknesses, etc.

## Module 3

### Comparable Precedent Transaction Analysis

#### Similarities between Public and Transaction Comparables

* ***Market-based***: Trading price for public comps; Acquisition price for transaction comps
* ***Multiples-based***: Judgment is required to select comparables and financial information; Spreading and adjusting financial information is virtuallly identical.

#### Differences 1 of 3

* Public comps are based on a current trading price and current financial results.
* Transaction comps are based on an acquisition price when the deal was announced and on financial information at the time of transaction, so transaction comps are "historical".
* Transaction comps tend to focus more on historical(latest twelve month) multiples while public comparables provide historical and projected multiples.

#### Differences 2 of 3

* Transaction comps reflect a "change of control" premium while public comps reflect a minority interest valuation.
* Transaction comps can also reflect ***synergies*** (if a strategic buyer) and potentially ***tax benefits*** resulting in ***higher valuation multiples***.
* Acquisition premiums can be calculated on transaction comparables when the target company is public at the time of acquisition.

#### Differences 3 of 3

* Once transaction comps are spread, they ***do not need to be updated*** whereas public comps need to be updated as the stock price changes and new filings become available.

### Steps to Performing Comparable Precedent Transaction Analysis

#### Precedent Transactions Analysis Steps

* Find and select comparable acquisitions;
* Locate the necessary deal-related and financial information;
* Spread and adjust financial and transactional information;
* Benchmark comparable acquisitions against the company you are valuing;
* Determine a reasonable range of implied valuation.

### Finding Transaction Comparables

#### Step 1: Select the Universe of Comparable Acquisitions

* Screen for comparable acquisitions
* Initial goal when screening for comparable acquisitions is to locate as many potential transactions as possible for a relevant, recent time period and then refine the universe.
* Sources for Creating an Initial List of Comparable Acquisitions: ***Search M&A databases***; ***Examine target's M&A history***; ***Revisit target's universe of comparable companies***; ***Search merger proxies for comparable acquisitions***; ***Review equity and fixed income research reports***.

### Unique Aspects of Spreading a Transaction Comparable

#### Unique Aspects of Spreading a Transaction

* ***Fully diluted shares*** and ***total enterprise value calculations***.
* Different forms of consideration: ***Cash***, ***Shares of acquiring company*** and ***Combination***.
* Calculation of premiums paid.
* ***Impact of synergies***.

#### Fully Diluted Shares and TEV Calculations

* In a transaction, RSUs and "outstanding" versus just "exercisable" options should be factored into fully diluted shares.
* Debt pre-payment penalities might need to be added to debt balances in a transaction comp as well.

#### Different Forms of Consideration

* Cash: OfferPrice * Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Equity Value;
* Stock (Shares of acquirer's stock): (Exchange Ratio * Acquirer's Share price) * Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Equity Value;
* Cash and Stock: (Cash Offer Price Per Share + Exchange Ratio * Acquirer's Share) * Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Equity Value.

#### Calculation of Premium Paid

* Offer Price Per Share / Unaffected Share Price - 1 = % Premium Paid.

#### Impact of Synergies

* Enterprise Value / LTM EBITDA
* Enterprise Value / (LTM EBITDA + Synergies)

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Comparable Transactions Analysis

#### Advantages of Comparable Precedent Transactions Analysis

* ***Market-based***: Analysis is based on actual acquisition multiples and premiums paid for similar companies.
* ***Current***: Recent transactions tend to reflect prevailing M&A, capital markets and general economic conditions.
* ***Relativity***: Multiples approach provides straightforward reference points across sectors and time periods.
* ***Simplicity***: Key multiples for a few selected transactions can anchor valuation.
* ***Objectivity***: Precedent-based and therefore, avoids making assumptiosn about company's future performance.

#### Disadvantages of Comparable Precedent Transactions Analysis

* ***Market-based***: Multiples may be skewed depending on capital markets and/or economic environment at the time of the transaction.
* ***Time-lag***: Precedent transactions, by definition, have occurred in the past and, therefore, may not be truly reflective of current market conditions.
* ***Difficult to find***: In some cases, it may be difficult to find a robust universe of precedent transactions.
* ***Availability of information***: Information may be insufficient to determine transaction multiples for many comparable acquisitions.
* ***Acquirer's basis for valuation***: May be based on buyer expectations regarding the target's future financial performance rather than reported LTM financial information.

## Module 4

### Discounted Cash Flows - An Introduction

#### Overview

* ***Intrinsic*** vs a ***market-based*** valuation technique.
* Premise: Value of a company can be derived from the present value (PV) of its projected free cahs flow (FCF).
* Key inputs: ***Sales growth rates***, ***Profit margins***, ***Capital expenditures***, ***Net working capital (NWC) requirements***.

#### Free Cash Flow

* Projected in detail for typically five years. Could be more for high growth / early stage companie.
* Terminal value is used to ***capture*** the remaining value of the target's free cash flow beyond the projection period.
* Projected FCF and terminal value are discounted to the present at the target's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
* Sum of present value (PV) of the projected FCF and terminal value = enterprise value.

#### DCF Steps

* Study the Target and Determine Key Performance Drivers.
* Project Free Cash Flow.
* Calculate Weighted Average Cost of Capital.
* Determine Terminal Value.
* Calculate Present Value and Determine Valuation.

### Discounted Cash Flows - Projecting Free Cash Flows

#### Overview

* Focus on ***Unlevered Free Cash Flow*** (UFCF).

Cash generated by a company after
* Cash operating expenses
* Cash taxes (NOT income statement taxes)
* Capital expenditures
* Changes in working capital
* ***Before*** interest expense (capital structure neutral)

#### Free Cash Flow

* Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
* Last: Taxes (at the Marginal Tax Rate)

Earnings Before Interest After Taxes

* Plus: Depreciation & Amortisation
* Less: Capital Expenditures
* Less: Increase/(Decrease) in Net Working Capital

#### Income Statement Drivers

* Total Revenue - (% Growth)
* Cost of Goods Sold - (% Margin)
* Selling, General and Administrative - (% Margin)
* Depreciation & Amortisation - (% Margin)
* Other Operating Expenses/(Income) - ($)
* Marginal Tax Rate - (%)

#### Balance Sheet Drivers

* Days
* Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
* Days Inventory Held (DIH)
* Prepaid Expenses (% of Total Revenue)
* Other Current Assets (% of Total Revenue)
* Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)
* Deferred Revenue (% of Total Revenue)
* Accrued Liabilities (% of Total Revenue)
* Other Current Liabilities (% of Total Revenue)

#### How Changes in Working Capital Impacts Cash Flow

* Excludes cas and short-term debt
* Increase in an asset is a ***USE*** of cash; a decrease is a ***SOURCE*** of cash.
* Increase in a liability is a ***SOURCE*** of cash and a decrease is a ***USE*** of cash.
* NWC increase is a ***USE*** of cash and a ****DEDUCT*** from unlevered free cash flow.

### Discounted Cash Flows - WACC

#### Overview

* Discount rate to calculate PV a company's projected FCF and terminal value.
* Opportunity cost of capital - what an investor would expect to earn in an alternative investment with a similar risk profile.
* Weighted average of the company's cost of debt (tax-effected) and cost of equity based on an assumed or "target" capital structure.

#### WACC Formula

* WACC = (After-tax Cost of Debt) * (% of Debt in the Capital Structure) + (Cost of Equity * % of Equity in the Capital Structure).
* WACC = $(r_{d}\times (1-t))\times \frac{D}{D+E} + r_{e}\times\frac{E}{D+E}$.

#### WACC Steps

* Determine Target Capital Structure
* Estimate Cost of Debt ($r_{d}$)
* Estimate Cost of Equity ($r_{e}$)
* Calculate WACC

#### Target Capital Structure

Represented by ratio of Debt and Equity to Total Capitalisation

* Total Capitalisation - Market Value of Equity + Debt (generally balance sheet - book value)

How to determine

* Current and historical levels
* Public comparables are good benchmark

* Public companies - generally use existing if in the range;
* Private companies - generally use comparable mean/median.

#### Cost of Debt

* Formula: $r_{d}\times(1-t)$, where $t$ = marginal tax rate.
Reflects company's credit profile at the target capital strucutre; key factors:
* Size
* Sector
* Outlook
* Cyclicality
* Credit ratings/credit statistics
* Cash flow generation

#### Cost of Equity

* Reflects rate of return equity investor expects to earn
* More judgment involved - not readily observable
* Use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) $$(\text{Cost of Equity}) r_{e} = \text{Risk-Free Rate} + \text{Levered Beta}\times\text{Market Rist Premium}.$$ $$(\text{Cost of Equity}) r_{e} = r_{f}+\beta_{L}\times(r_{m}-r_{f}) + \text{size premium},$$ where $r_{f} = \text{risk-free rate}, \beta_{L} = \text{levered beta}, r_{m} = \text{expected return on the market}, r_{m}-r_{f} = \text{market risk premium}.$

#### Risk Free Rate

* Expected rate of return obtained by investing in a "riskless" security.
* Generally look at Treasury rates - 10 or 30 years.

#### Beta

* Measures how stock moves relative to the market (S&P 500)
* $> 1$, stock moves more than $1 for every $1 that market moves
* $< 1$, stock moves less than $1 for every $1 that market moves

Bloomberg reports ***levered data***. To arrive at beta for private company,

* Determine comparables group (same as comparable companies)
* Unlever beta for each comparable company $$\beta_{U} = \frac{\beta_{L}}{1+\frac{D}{E}\times(1-t)},$$ where $\beta_{U} = \text{unlevered data}, \beta_{L} = \text{levered data}, D/E = \text{debt-to-equity ratio}, t = \text{marginal tax rate}.$

* Average unlevered data for the comparable group, Re-lever using company's target capital structure. $$\beta_{L} = \beta_{U}\times\left(1+\frac{D}{E}\times(1-t)\right),$$ where $D/E = \text{target debt-to-equity ratio}.$

#### Market Risk Premium

* Represents the spread of the expected market return over the risk-free rate.

#### Size Premium

* Concept - Smaller-sized companies are risker and should have a higher cost of equity.
* Add a size premium to the CAPM formula for smaller companies to account for thte preceived higher risk.

### Discounted Cash Flows - Terminal Value

#### Overview

* DCF represents PV of all future FCF produced by a company
* ***Infeasible*** to project a company's FCF indefinitely
* So use ***Terminal value*** to capture the value of the company beyond the projection period.
* Typically calculated on the basis of the company's FCF in the final year of the projection period
* Terminal value typically accounts for a substantial portion of a company's value in a DCF.
* Two widely accepted methods: ***Exit Multiple Method (EMM)*** and ***Perpetuity Growth Method (PGM)***.

#### Exit Multiple Method

* Calculate terminal value as a multiple of its terminal year EBITDA.
* Multiple is typically based on the current LTM trading multiples for comparable companies.
* Needs to be subjected to sensitivity analysis

$$\text{Terminal Value} = \text{EBITDA}_{n}\times\text{Exit Multiple},$$ where $n = \text{terminal year of the projected period}.$

#### Perpetuity Growth Method

* Calculates terminal value by treating a company's terminal year FCF as a perpetuity growing at an assumed rate.
* Relies on the WACC calculation ("r") and an assumption regarding the company's long-term, sustainable growth rate ("perpetuity growht rate" or "g").
* Tends to be within a range of 2% to 4% (i.e. nominal GDP growth) $$\text{Terminal Value} = \frac{FCF_{n}\times(1+g)}{r-g}.$$

#### Discounted Cash Flows - Calculate Present Value and Determine Valuation

#### Overview

* Follow concept of the ***time value of money*** : Dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.
* Discount each year's cash flows and terminal value using the WACC as the discount rate.
* Use WACC to calculate a discount factor for each period: $$\text{Discount Factor} = \frac{1}{(1+\text{WACC})^{n}},$$ while $$\text{Present Value Calculation Using a Year-End Discount Factor} = \text{FCF}_{n}\times\text{Discount Factor} _{n}.$$

#### Determining Enterprise Value

* Multiply each year's FCF and terminal value by appropriate discount factor
* Midyear convention - presumes cash flows occur ratably throughout the year: $$\text{Enterprise Value} = \frac{\text{FCF}1}{(1+\text{WACC})^{0.5}} + \frac{\text{FCF}2}{(1+\text{WACC})^{1.5}} + ... + \frac{\text{FCF}5}{(1+\text{WACC})^{4.5}} + \frac{\text{EBITDA5}\times\text{Exit Multiple}}{(1+\text{WACC})^{5}}.$$

#### Determining Equity Value

* DCF using UFCF arrives at an ***Enterprise Value***.
* Calculate Equity Value by deducting net debt, preferred stock, noncontrolloing interest
* Divide by fully diluted shares to arrive at per share price.

#### Sensitivity Analysis

DCF outcome significantly affected by certain key assumptions:
* WACC
* Exit multiple
* Perpetuity growth rate
* Common to perform sensitivity analyses to develop a valuation range

#### DCF Pros and Cons

Pros:

* Cash flow based
* Market independent
* Self-sufficient
* Flexible

Cons:

* Dependence on multiple years of projections
* Highly sensitive to assumptions
* Terminal value is significant component
* Constant capital structure
